    campaign: "Destination Anywhere Tour",
    description: "JBL asked us to create a 5-page print ad for their line of products. Each page should showcase one of their products. However, with the same budget, we managed to deliver a full campaign that highlighted a common theme: sound quality. Our main concept was to convey that using a JBL product feels like being at a concert. To achieve this, we invented a fictional tour and partnered with a couple of bands. Each tour venue was associated with a specific context for product use, such as ‘In Your Bedroom’ or ‘On Your Way to Work.’ We designed concert posters, t-shirts, booklets resembling concert tickets, a dedicated website, and even wrapped city buses to resemble tour buses. In the end, we not only delivered a comprehensive campaign but also created something unique and memorable.",

There's nothing that says LA more than the Hollywood Sign and there's nothing that says Playstation more than the icons on the controller buttons. So we merged both icons and created one with the tagline: E3 is coming to LA. We had that displayed in the main entrance and all over the venue in posters and banners.",

After conducting a blind taste test with several other brands, most of us chose Michelob as one of the best options. Inspired by this positive response, we developed the idea that people needed to try Michelob to be pleasantly surprised. To convey this concept in a fun and unique way, we created a campaign featuring illustrations of people in situations where they expected something else but received a Michelob beer instead. Rather than feeling disappointed, they were pleasantly surprised.",
